TODO:
START AT HOW TO TRIGGER PARTICLES
Add BOUNDARIES from the Laser Defender section
Add CINEMACHINE with edges from the Platformer section
Have Collisions trigger Gravity Off/On (Maybe from the Obstacle Course?)
  Maybe use Switch Statemenmts to create an invisible “Gate” that could trigger switching Physics On/Off
Instead of looping to first level - have an End Screen

Audio:
Video 41 - Should just be able to swap the audio clip being used by Audio Source on the PlayerShip

  --Check Brackeys

Laser Defender:
  Project Setup - Player Input Package - Bailed on this for now
    Also will be good for getting Assets from Kenney
  Unity Input System
  BOUNDARIES - NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

Project Boost:
  Basic Input Binding
  Rigidbody Constraints - Plays around with gravity and discusses how to simulate wind, but I'm not sure it's what I want
  Switch Statements
